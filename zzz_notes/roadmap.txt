Project Rook: Code Architecture Review and Roadmap
Architectural Overview
GameController (GameManager): The GameController is a central Node (attached to the Main scene) that holds references to key parts of the game via exported variables – the Board, the player’s pieces container, the enemy’s pieces container, the Camera, and UI
GitHub
. This node is responsible for orchestrating gameplay. Currently, in its _ready() it simply demonstrates functionality by waiting for the Board to be ready, then instancing a test Piece and placing it on the board
GitHub
. (It preloads a generic Piece scene and spawns one piece at a hard-coded location as a temporary test
GitHub
GitHub
.) In the future, this will expand to handle turn management, piece spawning, movement decisions, and overall game flow.
Board (BoardGridmap): The Board is implemented as a BoardGridmap Node3D with an attached Board script. It uses a Godot GridMap to represent an 8×8 chess board of tiles. On startup, the Board script scans all tiles and caches their coordinates and world positions in a dictionary for quick lookup
GitHub
. For example, Board.scan_tiles() iterates over every used cell in the GridMap, converts the 3D grid cell to a 2D board coordinate (column/file and row/rank), and stores the tile’s global position keyed by that coordinate
GitHub
. This lets the game quickly get a world position from a board coordinate via Board.get_grid_position(x, y)
GitHub
. The Board script is also set up to assist with movement logic: it includes a helper scan_direction() function to check tiles in a straight line from a starting position
GitHub
. This will return a list of grid coordinates in one direction (up to a max range), stopping if it goes out of bounds or hits an occupied tile
GitHub
. (This is useful for moves like the rook or bishop which travel until blocked.) Currently, the board is a standalone scene instanced in Main, and the GameController interacts with it to place or query tiles. The board uses an Enums script for board coordinates: for instance, tile coordinates are stored as Vector2i with X = file (A–H) and Y = rank (1–8), and the Board can combine these into human-readable IDs like "A1"
GitHub
. Note: The project also defines a BoardTile script (Node3D) with signals for tile hover and click
GitHub
, but since the board is built with a GridMap (which doesn’t create individual Tile nodes), the BoardTile script isn’t actively used at the moment. Instead, tile interactions will likely be handled via ray-casting or another method rather than per-tile nodes.
Piece and Component Structure: Each chess piece in Project Rook is designed as a Node3D (Piece) that contains several child nodes for different aspects of the piece. The Piece.gd script (class Piece) has exported Node variables for a VisualsComponent, MovementComponent, PieceStats, and ModifiersComponent
GitHub
. In the piece scene (piece.tscn or specific piece scenes like rook.tscn), these correspond to child nodes: for example, a VisualsComponent (holding the 3D model or sprite for the piece), a MovementComponent (intended to handle movement rules/logic), a StatsComponent (holding piece stats such as type, health, etc.), and a ModifiersComponent (for power-ups or status effects on the piece). This is a modular, component-based design – instead of one giant piece script, each aspect of the piece’s behavior or data is separated into its own script. Currently, these component scripts are essentially stubs (empty classes)
GitHub
GitHub
GitHub
, but they establish a clear structure for future development. The Piece node also stores its current board position (board_pos as a Vector2i)
GitHub
, which will be updated whenever the piece moves. (This position is meant to sync with the Board’s grid coordinate system, so the game always knows where the piece is on the board.)
FactionPieces containers: The scene has two Node3D containers named PlayerPieces and EnemyPieces, each using the FactionPieces script (class FactionPieces)
GitHub
GitHub
. These act as group holders for all piece instances belonging to each side. Right now, FactionPieces.gd is basically an empty Node3D class (just a named container)
GitHub
. In the current setup, when the GameController spawns a new piece, it adds the piece as a child under the appropriate Faction node (e.g. adding a new piece under player_pieces for the player side)
GitHub
. This structure makes it easy to separate and manage pieces by team. In the future, the FactionPieces script could be expanded to maintain a dictionary of its pieces’ positions or provide helper methods to iterate over pieces, but as of now its primary purpose is organization (it allows grouping, and you could also use Godot’s groups system or these dedicated nodes interchangeably).
Enumerations and Data Assets: The project includes an Enums.gd script (as a global class) that defines various enums and constants used in the game
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, it defines an enum for PieceType (PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING), for PieceColor (WHITE, BLACK), for board Files (A through H) and Ranks (_1 through _8), and even a dictionary of direction vectors (DIRS) for movements like “up”, “down-left”, etc.
GitHub
. It also defines a GameTurn enum (PLAYER or ENEMY) for turn-taking
GitHub
. These enums make the code more readable (e.g. using Enums.PieceType.ROOK instead of a raw integer for a piece type). Another data asset in the repo is PieceSkin.gd (a Resource script) which is meant to define piece appearance/skin data – it includes fields for an ID, a piece type, a PackedScene reference (the scene to instantiate for that piece), and an optional material override
GitHub
. This suggests the project intends to support multiple piece designs or “skins” for the same type of piece. Currently, however, these data-driven features (skins, piece types) are not yet hooked into the gameplay – for instance, the test piece spawned is using a placeholder scene and texture. The architecture is laying the groundwork to easily swap models or sprites for pieces by loading different PieceSkin resources without changing game logic.
In summary, the current architecture consists of a GameController (manager) orchestrating a Board and two groups of Piece nodes. Each Piece is composed of modular sub-nodes for visuals, movement, stats, and modifiers. The Board provides the grid and helper functions for spatial logic. The design is cleanly separated, which will help the developer (a self-taught novice) implement complex features in an organized way as the project grows.
Best Practices Feedback
Clear Naming and Consistency: Overall, the project’s class and node naming is understandable (e.g. GameController, Board, Piece, FactionPieces). A few improvements could make it more consistent: for example, the PieceStats component’s script file is named stats_component.gd while the class is called PieceStats
GitHub
 – it might be clearer to match the file name to the class (e.g. piece_stats.gd) or vice-versa, so it’s obvious that script corresponds to the Piece’s stats. Similarly, consider whether to include the word "Component" in all component classes for consistency: currently VisualsComponent, MovementComponent, ModifiersComponent include “Component” in the class name, but PieceStats does not. Aligning these (e.g. calling it StatsComponent or naming the others PieceVisuals, etc.) would reduce confusion. Also ensure node names in scenes correspond clearly to their function (which you’ve mostly done: e.g. a child node named "MovementComponent" uses the MovementComponent script). The use of a leading underscore in folder names (like _board/, _pieces/) is a stylistic choice – it can indicate these are internal assets – just be consistent with such conventions. Finally, the GameController is essentially acting as a game manager; naming it “GameManager” in code/comments (as mentioned in your notes) might be more semantically clear, but this is minor. The key is to stay consistent with terminology to avoid mix-ups (for instance, your scratchpad calls it GameManager
GitHub
 while the class is GameController). Pick one term for the central controller and stick with it in code and documentation for clarity.
Separation of Concerns (Modular Design): You’ve wisely started to separate game logic into distinct areas – this is a great practice, especially in Godot. The use of components for pieces (visuals, movement, stats, modifiers) shows an understanding of composition over monolithic design. Continue this approach: each component should handle its own area of responsibility. For example, the VisualsComponent can load and update the piece’s appearance (meshes or sprite frames, handling animations or material changes when a skin is applied), without knowing anything about game rules. The MovementComponent can encapsulate how a piece computes its possible moves or executes a move, without dealing with UI or other game logic. PieceStats can simply store data (like the piece’s type, health points, attack power, etc. depending on your game’s twist on chess) and perhaps provide methods to modify those stats. ModifiersComponent can manage temporary effects or power-ups affecting the piece (for instance, an increase in range or a status like “stunned”). Keeping these concerns separate will make your life easier when the project grows – you’ll know exactly where to add new code for a given feature. Just be sure to implement the interactions between these components clearly. For instance, if a power-up affects movement range, the ModifiersComponent might communicate that to the MovementComponent (or the MovementComponent could query Modifiers when calculating moves). Using Godot’s signals or method calls between sibling nodes can help components interact without being too tightly coupled. Overall, the architecture is set up well for a modular approach – just remember to actually populate these components with the logic/data they’re meant to handle as you move forward (right now they are empty shells).
Signals and Communication: Embracing Godot’s signal system will greatly improve the flow of your game and keep the code decoupled. Your design notes already suggest using signals for things like piece selection
GitHub
, which is excellent. In practice, you should implement a signal clicked(piece, board_pos) in the Piece script (as sketched in your scratchpad) and connect it to the GameController. For example, each Piece could have a CollisionShape/StaticBody for input, and on _input_event it would emit a signal with itself and its coordinates
GitHub
. The GameController can connect to all pieces’ “clicked” signals (either by looping through children or using a group as in your notes) and handle the event centrally
GitHub
. This way, when the player clicks a piece, the GameController immediately knows which piece and where it is – without having to search the board or manage global state, the piece itself tells the manager “I was clicked at (x,y)”. The same goes for tile selection: if you decide to use the BoardTile nodes, you could connect each tile’s tile_clicked signal to notify GameController which tile was clicked
GitHub
. If instead you use a raycast approach for tile clicking (since you’re using GridMap), you might not use a signal from each tile but rather have the raycast code in the Camera or GameController emit a signal or call a function when a particular tile coordinate is determined. Either way, prefer signals/events over tightly coupling nodes. For example, the Board can emit a signal when it finishes scanning or setting up (a “ready” signal) and GameController can wait for that instead of using a manual await. In fact, in your code you do await board.ready
GitHub
, which implies a Board signal ready – you should add signal ready in Board.gd and emit it at the end of _ready() (after scan_tiles() completes). This would be a cleaner way to let GameController know the Board is initialized (currently, without defining the signal, await board.ready won’t function as expected). In summary, use signals to handle interactions like piece clicked, tile hovered (for highlighting), move made, etc., so that your GameController (or other managers) can respond without hard references. This will make your code more flexible — for instance, you could later add AI by emitting a similar signal or calling the same move function that a UI click would, and the game logic wouldn’t care if the move came from a player or AI.
Godot Scene & Script Organization: You’ve organized your scenes and scripts logically (board-related stuff in a _board folder, piece-related in _pieces, global scripts in a scripts folder). This is fine; just maintain consistency so you can find things easily. One suggestion is to possibly keep script files alongside their scenes for clarity (as you did with pieces and board), or use a naming convention that pairs them (e.g. BoardGridmap scene uses Board.gd script). It might also help to use an Autoload for certain singletons: for example, Enums is currently a class with class_name Enums which works, but you could also consider making an autoload script for global constants if needed. Not mandatory, but an option if you find you have global state or utilities. For grouping, you might use Godot’s Group system in addition to the Faction node containers – for instance, you could add all pieces (both factions) to a group "pieces" to iterate easily, or use separate groups "player_pieces" and "enemy_pieces". This would allow things like get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("pieces") to get all pieces for a quick signal hookup
GitHub
. Since you already have Faction containers, it’s not strictly necessary, but groups are a built-in way to organize nodes that span different branches of the scene tree. Consider it for convenience (you can add nodes to groups via code or the editor). Also, be mindful of the scene tree order and node parenting. Right now, GameController and Board are siblings in the scene, so GameController’s _ready ran before Board was ready – hence the need for await. Another approach could be to make GameController a parent of Board or ensure the Board node appears above GameController in the scene hierarchy so that Board initializes first. Godot calls _ready on children before parents, and nodes in the scene tree from top to bottom. Adjusting hierarchy can sometimes eliminate the need for waiting on readiness. But if reordering nodes isn’t desirable, the signal approach mentioned earlier is perfectly good.
Type Annotations and GDScript style: You are making use of GDScript’s static typing, which is great for catching errors early. Keep adding type hints for variables, function parameters, and return types throughout the project. For example, you’ve typed the exported Node references (Board, Camera3D, etc.)
GitHub
 and dictionaries in Board (Dictionary[Vector2i, Vector3i] for tile positions)
GitHub
. Continue this practice for new code – e.g., when you implement movement logic, annotate functions like get_moves(): Array[Vector2i] or move_to(tile: Vector2i) -> void. This will help you as a novice to ensure you’re passing the right types (Godot will warn you if not) and makes the code self-documenting. Another good practice is to use @onready for node references (as you did for the GridMap in Board
GitHub
) so you safely get child nodes once they’re in the scene tree. You might do similarly for things like a CollisionShape within a piece, etc. Also, remember to remove or tone down debugging prints once things are verified – for instance, Board._ready() currently prints all tile positions
GitHub
 which is fine for now, but you’ll likely want to remove that spam later. In terms of GDScript style, the code is clean and uses comments like “HACK” and “FIXME” to mark temporary solutions
GitHub
GitHub
. This is fine (it shows you know those parts need improvement); just make sure to address them in time. For example, the hard-coded PIECE preload in GameController is a HACK
GitHub
 – eventually you’ll want a more flexible way to instantiate the correct piece types (see the roadmap below on using the PieceSkin resource instead of a single hard-coded scene). Continue writing self-explanatory comments, but also consider using the TODO plugin you installed to track tasks. Writing # TODO: ... in code will allow the Todo_Manager plugin to pick them up so you have a list of things to do (similar to how you used HACK/FIXME). This can be useful to keep track of unfinished parts.
In summary, the project’s code structure is quite good for a beginner project – you have a solid separation and use of advanced features like exported nodes, tool scripts, and signals. The main recommendations are to follow through on the intended design (implement those components and signals), maintain consistency in naming, and leverage Godot’s systems (signals, groups, typed GDScript) to keep the code clean and flexible. Don’t be afraid to simplify if needed – for instance, if GridMap complicates input handling, you could revert to instancing 64 BoardTile scenes for simplicity – but it’s also a great learning experience to make the GridMap approach work with raycasting. The key is to ensure each system (Board, Piece, GameController, etc.) communicates properly via clear interfaces (methods or signals) and that responsibilities are well-defined.
Project Plan and Roadmap
Now let’s outline a roadmap for completing Project Rook, focusing on what’s already implemented vs. what remains. The major planned features include modular piece movement, tile scanning integration, power-ups, and skins. We’ll address each, explain the current state, and suggest how and where to implement the remaining parts. The roadmap is structured in a logical sequence (you likely want to get movement working before power-ups, etc.):
Piece Movement System (Selection, Movement, and Turn Logic): Currently, the game does not have a real movement system – pieces are just placed on the board. The foundation is there: each Piece knows its board coordinates (board_pos)
GitHub
 and the Board can calculate positions and scan lines of tiles. The next step is to let the player select a piece and move it to a target tile, following the rules. Here’s how to proceed:
Selection Input: Implement input handling so that clicking a piece selects it. As discussed, you can give each Piece a CollisionShape or Area and connect its input to emit a clicked(piece, pos) signal
GitHub
. The GameController (or a dedicated Input/Selection manager) should listen for this signal
GitHub
 and respond by highlighting that piece’s possible moves. If using GridMap without individual tile nodes, you can instead use a RayCast (attached to the camera or as an invisible node) to detect what the player clicks on. For instance, when the player clicks, cast a ray from the camera through the mouse position into the 3D world. If it hits a piece’s collider, treat it as selecting that piece. If it hits the board (a tile), you’ll need to determine which tile was clicked – GridMap has methods to convert a world hit position to a grid coordinate (or you can compare against the dictionary of tile positions you cached). In summary, the game needs a way to translate a click to either a piece or a board coordinate. This is a high-priority step to make the game interactive.
Highlighting and Tile Scanning: Once a piece is selected, calculate its legal moves. This is where your tile scanning comes into play. For a given piece and its position, use the movement rules to generate a list of target coordinates. You might encode movement rules by piece type. For example, a Rook can move in straight lines (up, down, left, right) until blocked – you can use the Board.scan_direction() function for each of the four cardinal directions
GitHub
, with max_steps = 7 (the board size minus 1). The Board’s scan will give you all empty squares in a direction until an obstacle. (Note: you’ll need to provide a data structure of occupied squares to scan_direction – likely a dictionary or map of all pieces on the board. This could be maintained by GameController or by combining the player_pieces and enemy_pieces containers. Right now, scan_direction tries to call piece_map.board.is_inside(pos), which hints that you should implement an is_inside() method on Board to check bounds
GitHub
. You can replace that logic with a simple check like if pos.x < 0 or pos.x > 7 or pos.y < 0 or pos.y > 7: break for an 8x8 grid, or actually write a Board.is_inside(Vector2i) that returns true/false for in-range coordinates and use that.) For other pieces: a Bishop would use scan_direction on the four diagonal directions; the Queen is basically rook + bishop moves (all 8 directions); the Knight doesn’t move linearly, so for Knights you might pre-compute the 8 L-shaped offsets (e.g. (2,1), (2,-1), (-2,1), etc.) and then simply check if those target squares are on board and not occupied (the Enums or a utility function can provide these offsets, or you hardcode them). Pawn movement is more complex (forward one, or two from start, and diagonal captures); you can handle that with special logic in the Pawn’s movement component or in the move generation function (taking into account piece color/direction). At this stage, implement these rules in the MovementComponent or related script. One approach is to give each piece’s Stats or Movement component a property indicating what kind of mover it is (e.g. PieceType or a set of directions and range). Since you have an enum for PieceType
GitHub
, the MovementComponent could check the piece’s type and run the appropriate logic. Alternatively, you could create specialized movement logic per piece subclass (e.g. a Rook.gd script could override a method to generate moves), but that might be overkill. Using data from Enums and a few if/match statements inside MovementComponent is fine for a novice project.
Executing Moves: After highlighting possible moves (you can highlight by enabling a visual indicator on those tiles – perhaps instancing a "highlight" sprite or changing tile color; if using GridMap, you might temporarily swap the tile mesh or place a transparent marker object), you allow the player to click one of the highlighted tiles to move there. That click can again be detected via raycast or tile signal. When a destination is chosen, the GameController should tell the selected Piece to move. This could be as simple as setting the piece’s board_pos = target_coord and updating its global position via Board.get_grid_position() as you did in the test
GitHub
. It would also involve capturing any piece on that target tile: you should check if the target coordinate is occupied by an enemy piece, and if so, remove that enemy piece (queue it for deletion or move it off-board). You can utilize the containers to find if an enemy piece has that coordinate (maintaining a dictionary of positions to pieces will help here – e.g., GameController could have a board_map dictionary mapping Vector2 -> Piece, updated whenever pieces move or are added, which was hinted at in your code comments
GitHub
). After moving the piece node (and possibly playing a move animation or sound), clear any highlights and proceed to the next step: switching turns.
Turn Management: Using the GameTurn enum
GitHub
, implement a simple turn toggle in GameController. Your GameController already had a commented current_turn variable
GitHub
 – you can revive that. For instance, when a player moves a piece, set current_turn = GameTurn.ENEMY and then trigger the enemy’s move. If initially you’re not implementing AI, the “enemy turn” could simply be a placeholder or a prompt for the player to press a button to continue (or you could automatically switch back if you only plan player vs player on one machine). Eventually, you might script AI moves for the enemy: you could either random-move a piece or implement a simple strategy. But that can come later. The immediate need is to enforce that a player can’t move two pieces in a row if you intend a turn-based system. In the interim, you might lock input during enemy turn (even if enemy doesn’t do anything) just to get the structure right. In code, you might wrap the selection/move logic with a check like if current_turn == GameTurn.PLAYER to only allow input on player turn. After the move, toggle the turn and (if you have AI) call an AI routine or, if not, toggle back to player after a delay. This sets the stage for adding AI later if desired.
Summary for Movement: This is the most crucial step to implement next: it will involve updating the MovementComponent script to generate moves (possibly using Board’s scanning for line moves), updating GameController to handle selection and moves (or creating a separate script to manage selection and highlight, which could even be part of a UI or the camera). The good news is the structure is largely in place: the Board gives you positions and boundaries, pieces know their coordinates, and you have enums and even a directions dictionary to help with move logic. Focus on one piece type at a time – for instance, get Rook movement working (straight lines), then Knight (jump moves), etc., reusing and extending the code as needed. By the end of this step, you should be able to click a piece, see where it can go, and click a destination to move it there, with the game tracking which squares are occupied.
Power-Ups and Modifiers: Once basic chess movement and capturing works, you can introduce power-ups or special abilities to make Project Rook more than standard chess. Currently, the concept of power-ups is only implied by the empty ModifiersComponent on each piece
GitHub
. There are no power-up items or effects implemented yet. Here’s how you might proceed:
Design the Power-ups: Decide what kind of power-ups or modifiers you want in the game. For example, you might have a power-up that increases a piece’s movement range, one that improves attack (if you have an RPG aspect), or something that allows a special move (like teleportation or an extra turn). Since this is a beginner project, start simple – maybe a “speed boost” power-up that lets a pawn move two extra squares, or a “shield” that gives a piece extra hit points (if you implement HP in PieceStats).
Representing Power-ups on the Board: You’ll need a way to place power-ups on certain tiles. One approach is to create a PowerUp scene (could be a simple Area3D or Node3D with a mesh/sprite and a script). Each power-up could have a type (or you could reuse the Modifiers enum if you define one, or just identify by node name). You can place these power-up nodes on the board at the start of a level or spawn them randomly. For example, at the beginning of the game, you might spawn a “PowerUp” on D4 and G7, etc. The Board could have a list of special tiles or the GameController could handle spawning them.
Picking up Power-ups: When a piece moves onto a tile that contains a power-up, that piece should acquire the power-up’s effect. How to detect this? If you maintain a board_map of pieces, you can similarly maintain a dictionary of power-ups on the board by coordinate. After a piece moves, check if target_coord is in the power-up map. If yes, you found a power-up at that location. You can then apply its effect: for instance, add a modifier to the piece’s ModifiersComponent. The ModifiersComponent script can be expanded to hold a list or dictionary of active modifiers on that piece. You might define a small Modifier resource or data structure (for example, a Dictionary like { "type": "speed_boost", "value": 2, "duration": 3_turns } or similar) and store it in the ModifiersComponent. For now, it could be as simple as storing a flag like piece.modifiers.has_speed_boost = true. Alternatively, you could skip an explicit object and just directly modify the piece’s stats in response to the power-up (e.g. increase a stat). But a cleaner way is to encapsulate it: e.g., have a method ModifiersComponent.apply_modifier(mod_type) which adjusts the Piece or its Stats accordingly (maybe increasing a movement range variable, etc.), and perhaps tracks how long it lasts.
Effect on Gameplay: Ensure that the effects of modifiers are taken into account. For example, if a piece gets a “range +2” modifier, the MovementComponent or move-generation logic should check the ModifiersComponent of that piece when calculating moves. This means MovementComponent might need to query something like parent.modifiers.has("range_boost") or the Stats component might have an updated stat that Movement uses. A simple way is to move any dynamic attributes (like current move range) into PieceStats, and let power-ups modify those stats. For instance, a rook might normally have a move range of 7 (the board size), but a power-up could increase that to, say, 7+2 (though on an 8x8 board range is naturally capped at 7 in one direction, but imagine a bigger board or different game modes). Or a pawn that normally moves 1 could temporarily move 2 every turn, etc. These decisions depend on the game design you envision.
User Feedback: When a piece picks up a power-up, provide feedback – e.g. you could play an effect, or change the piece’s color or icon to show it’s powered up. The VisualsComponent could handle this, perhaps by changing the material or adding an indicator (maybe an icon above the piece). And when a modifier expires (if it has a duration), remember to remove it and revert any stat changes.
Implementation Location: A lot of the power-up logic will live in GameController (for spawning power-ups and detecting pickups) and in the Piece’s components (ModifiersComponent to store effects, Stats/Movement to incorporate their impact, Visuals to possibly indicate them). The ModifiersComponent.gd script can be expanded with methods like add_modifier(modifier: Modifier) and remove_modifier(type) and signals like modifier_added if needed (though direct method calls are fine). GameController can have a list of active power-ups on the board (or simply a list of power-up nodes as children of Board or a dedicated node). You might make the Board or a new node handle the placement of power-ups (e.g., a child node of Board called PowerUps that contains all power-up instances on the grid). The exact structure can vary, but the key is to have a clear flow: spawn power-up -> piece lands on it -> apply effect to piece -> remove power-up from board.
Current State vs Future: Right now, none of the above exists except the empty ModifiersComponent hook. So this is a feature you’d build after getting movement working. It will add a fun layer to the game, and your component-based design is ready for it – just fill in the ModifiersComponent logic and ensure the other parts of the code check for modifiers. This can be implemented incrementally: you could start by hard-coding one effect (like “increase move range”) to see it work, then expand to more types.
Piece Skins and Cosmetic Customization: The project already anticipates having different skins or models for pieces. You have a PieceSkin resource class defined
GitHub
, which can hold an ID, a piece type, a PackedScene, and an optional Material. As of now, however, the game always instantiates the same generic piece scene (with a placeholder rook sprite) for testing
GitHub
. Implementing the skins system will make the game more visually interesting and flexible:
Define Skin Resources: You can create .tres resource files of type PieceSkin for each piece design you have. For example, you might have a “Classic” set: Classic/Rook, Classic/Knight, etc., each referencing the appropriate scene (rook.tscn, knight.tscn, etc.) and textures or materials. You could also have an alternate set (e.g. “Fantasy” or “Sci-fi” pieces). The id field in PieceSkin (e.g. "Classic/Rook") can help identify which set and piece it is. If you haven’t already, create the scenes for each piece type (you have rook.tscn; you’d need others like pawn.tscn, knight.tscn, etc., or you can reuse a generic piece scene for multiple types initially). Ensure each such scene has the same structure (a Node3D with VisualsComponent, etc.) so they’re compatible.
Skin Selection: Decide how the game chooses which skin to use. It could be as simple as a constant that says “use Classic set for now”. Or you could expose an option in UI for the player to pick a skin set before the game. As a first pass, you might hardcode it. For instance, in GameController when spawning pieces at game start, you could load a specific set of PieceSkin resources into a dictionary for quick access. For example, have a dictionary like skin_set = { PieceType.ROOK: load("res://skins/Classic_Rook.tres"), ... } for all pieces. Then instead of preloading a generic piece.tscn, you would do something like: var rook_skin := skin_set[Enums.PieceType.ROOK] and then var piece_scene = rook_skin.scene (which is a PackedScene), then var piece_instance = piece_scene.instantiate(). If there’s a material override, you can apply it to the piece’s Visuals (or the Sprite/Mesh in VisualsComponent) by setting material_override or so.
Applying Skins to Pieces: The VisualsComponent script can be responsible for taking a PieceSkin resource and actually updating the visuals. For example, VisualsComponent might have a function apply_skin(skin: PieceSkin) that sets its sprite’s texture or model’s mesh/material accordingly. In your current setup, if each piece scene already has the correct sprite (like rook.tscn uses the rook sprite), you might not need to dynamically change it – you’d just instantiate the scene that already has the right appearance. The Material field in PieceSkin could be used if you want to recolor or theme the pieces (e.g. a gold material vs normal).
Multiple Skins or Skin Unlocks: If you plan to have multiple skin sets, you could extend this by having a Skin Manager or simply by loading different sets based on player choice. For now, implementing one set through the PieceSkin structure will validate that your design works. It separates the concept of a piece’s type/logic from its look. For example, you might have two Rook skins that both correspond to piece type “ROOK” in logic – the game logic doesn’t care which skin, it just knows it’s a rook piece.
Current vs Future: At present, the code uses a single piece.tscn for everything, so all pieces would look identical. Also, your rook.tscn and piece.tscn seem very similar structure-wise (one might be an inherited scene of the other, or just two approaches). Eventually, you might not need a generic piece.tscn if you have specific ones for each type; or you could use piece.tscn as a base scene and make each specific piece (rook, knight) an inherited scene with the same structure but different sprite/mesh. Either approach works. The roadmap step here is: integrate the PieceSkin data. That likely means adjusting GameController’s setup of pieces. Instead of const PIECE = preload("...piece.tscn")

, you’ll have logic to load and create the appropriate scene per piece. For example, when setting up the initial chess board, for each square that should have a piece, do something like: determine the piece type (e.g. A1 = White Rook), get the PieceSkin for "White/Rook", instantiate it, set its piece.stats.piece_type (if you store that in stats), and add it to the PlayerPieces container. This also ties in with using the Stats component – you might store the piece’s type and maybe its color in PieceStats (so that a piece knows “I am a White Rook”). That can be set when you instantiate from a skin or by logic from position (in chess initial setup, certain coordinates correspond to certain pieces).
Visual Enhancements: Once skins are working, you can further polish the visuals. For example, use 3D models for pieces instead of sprites if available, or add animations. The VisualsComponent can manage animations (like a little bounce or glow when selected, or a death animation when captured). These are enhancements to consider after the core game is functional. They won’t affect gameplay logic but will improve user experience. Keep the VisualsComponent strictly for visuals – it should react to state (like selection or capture events) possibly via signals (e.g. GameController could emit a signal “piece_selected(piece)” that VisualsComponent listens to and then highlights that piece).
UI for Skins (optional): If you want to allow skin switching in-game or a menu to choose skins, that would involve UI work. For now, it’s probably okay to decide on one set in code. But knowing you have a flexible system means later you could add a dropdown or button to swap out the resource set and respawn pieces with new looks (or even live-change their visuals by reapplying skins).
Other Considerations (Beyond the Current Scope): After the above systems are in place, you’ll have a functioning strategy board game with extra features. There are a few more things you might consider down the line (just to be thorough in the roadmap):
User Interface and Feedback: Currently the UI node is empty

. Eventually, you’ll want to display information to the player – for example, whose turn it is, what piece is selected, maybe a score or captured pieces count, or health bars if using HP for pieces. Plan to use the UI Control node for such overlays. Even something simple like a label that shows the name of the piece you clicked (“White Rook at A3”) or a turn indicator (“Player Turn”) can enhance clarity.
Sound and Effects: Add sound effects for moves, captures, and power-up pickups. Godot’s AudioSystem can play sound nodes or one-shot audio. Visual effects (particles when a power-up is picked up, etc.) also make the game feel polished. These would be handled by the VisualsComponent or a separate Effects node.
AI for Enemy Moves: If this game is intended to be single-player, you’ll need the enemy side to make moves. That’s a complex topic (writing a chess AI or similar), but you could simplify it given the power-up twist (the game might not need full chess AI). Even random valid moves, or targeting the player’s strongest piece, etc., could be a start. Implementing AI would involve using the same move-generation logic you wrote for the player to evaluate possible moves for enemy pieces. This would fit into GameController: on the enemy’s turn, compute a move for one of the enemy’s pieces (perhaps at random or with simple heuristics) and then apply it (with a short delay for effect).
Victory/End Conditions: Determine how the game ends. In chess, it’s checkmate of the king. In your game, if you keep chess rules, you’ll need to check for checkmate/stalemate. If you have a different objective (maybe accumulate points or survive a number of turns, etc.), implement that. You can monitor conditions each turn in GameController (e.g. if the enemy king is captured, declare victory).
Testing and Debugging: As you implement each feature, test it thoroughly. Since you are new, tackle one thing at a time. For example, get the selection and movement working for one piece type before adding all types. Use print statements or Godot’s debugger to ensure the coordinates and moves are correct. For instance, print out the moves generated by MovementComponent for a piece to verify it matches expectations. The component structure might require you to carefully get references (e.g. a MovementComponent might need to call get_parent() to get the Piece or Board node). Ensure you use those correctly and that you don’t accidentally duplicate logic in multiple places. Aim to keep logic in the most appropriate script (e.g., Board for general board queries, MovementComponent for piece-specific move generation, GameController for overall turn flow).
Code Cleanup: Remove the temporary/testing code like the hard-coded test piece spawn once you have the real initialization (e.g., spawning a full set of pieces) in place. Also, implement the stubbed functions or remove unused ones. For example, if you end up not using BoardTile.gd at all, you can remove it from the project to avoid confusion – or keep it if you think you might switch to that approach, but then use it consistently. Likewise, update comments as the code evolves (the “HACK” comments can be resolved once you implement the proper systems).
By following this roadmap, you will first establish the core gameplay loop (piece selection -> move -> turn switch), then layer on the unique features (power-ups/modifiers that modify that gameplay), and finally polish with cosmetic choices (skins, UI, effects). At each step, the existing architecture will support you: for example, when implementing movement, use the Board’s data and the enums for directions; when implementing power-ups, use the ModifiersComponent to keep that logic modular; when adding skins, use the PieceSkin resources to keep visuals separate from logic. Each system should be implemented in the script that makes the most sense: e.g., movement calculations in MovementComponent/Board, turn logic in GameController, power-up application in ModifiersComponent/PieceStats, etc., with GameController coordinating the high-level events (like “move complete, now check power-ups and end turn”). Current Implementation vs. Planned Features Recap: To summarize, implemented systems so far include the board setup (the 3D board with coordinates), a basic piece node structure with components, and a test for spawning/moving a piece manually. Planned systems that are sketched but not yet done include: a full movement rule system (modular per piece), using the board’s tile scanning to determine moves, a turn-based mechanic, interactive input (clicking pieces/tiles), a power-up mechanism (with pieces gaining modifiers from board pickups), and a skinning system for piece appearance customization. Each of these planned features has a clear place in the current architecture:
Movement rules will live in the MovementComponent (with help from Board methods and piece data).
Tile scanning is already partially provided by the Board class (just ensure to refine functions like scan_direction and add any others needed for knights, etc.).
Power-ups will utilize the ModifiersComponent on pieces and likely some manager in the Board or GameController to place and remove them.
Skins will use the PieceSkin Resource and the VisualsComponent or instancing logic in GameController to apply models/textures to pieces.
By approaching each feature methodically and using the structure you’ve built, you’ll gradually turn this foundation into a complete game. Good luck, and happy coding! 🎮
